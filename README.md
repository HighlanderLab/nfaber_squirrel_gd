This git repository contains the code used to model gene drives in a mouse 
population for the PhD thesis of G. R. McFarlane. The model is adapted from 
Prowse et al. (2017) by Dr. G. Gorjanc and N. R. Faber. 

To run the code:
Save the gene_drive_mouse.R code and the script you want to run. In that script, 
change the working directory and the path to the gene_drve.R code and run!
